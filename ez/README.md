Please include a README.md that explains how to quickly install [if necessary] and your project. Include a few examples about how to interact with your project within the README document. This document is separate from your paper that provides more details about the project. The README is used to quickly start running your project.

To run our project:
1. cd to directry ez (from proj-ez inside environmnet after installing requirements)
2. in command line run python3 __main__.py. This will call our record_link.py file and our server.py
which are the two main components of our analysis. The record link compares data between citizen and
chicago crime data portal, and the server creates visual of the 'mock' incidents that ECCSC responded to.
